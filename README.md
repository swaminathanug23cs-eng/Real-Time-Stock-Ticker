A *real-time stock ticker* is a digital display or software tool that provides continuous, up-to-the-second updates on stock prices as they are traded on financial markets. It shows the latest prices, price changes, trading volume, and other relevant data for various securities. This information is streamed live from stock exchanges, allowing investors, traders, and analysts to monitor market movements instantly without delays.

Traditionally, stock tickers were displayed on electronic boards in financial institutions or broadcast on television channels dedicated to business news. Today, real-time stock tickers are integrated into online trading platforms, financial websites, and mobile apps. These modern systems use data feeds provided by exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ to ensure that the displayed prices reflect the most current market activity.

The main purpose of a real-time stock ticker is to help market participants make timely and informed trading decisions. By watching price fluctuations and trends as they happen, traders can react quickly to market changes, capitalize on opportunities, or minimize potential losses. Real-time data is especially critical in fast-moving markets, where even a few seconds can significantly impact the value of a trade.
